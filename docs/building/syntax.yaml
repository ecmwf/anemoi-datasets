# The name of the dataset (optional, but recommended). This entry is ingrored by anemoi-datasets
# but use by some tools to identify the dataset. Best practice is to use hyphens, not underscores or camel case, as these names
# will be used to build URLs.

# The range of dates covered by the dataset (compulsory).
# The various source are called with a list of dates build from start, end and frequency.
# How the dates are used by the sources depends on the source (gridded or tabular).
# The frequency can be given in human friendly format (e.g. 6h, 1d) or in ISO 8601 format (e.g. PT6H, P1D).
# All dates are always undestood as UTC.

  start: 2000-01-01 00:00:00

build:
  group_by: 10 # The number of dates to process together (e.g. 10, monthly, weekly, etc.)

# List of options to control the generation of statistics (optional)
# Defaults are inferred from the dates section if not provided, using some heuristics
