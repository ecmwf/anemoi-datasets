 Dataset naming conventions
############################

A dataset name is a string used to identify a dataset. It is designed to
be human readable and is *not* designed to be parsed and splitted into
parts.

To ensure consistency, a dataset name should follow the following rules:

   -  All lower case.
   -  Only letters and numbers and dashes ``-`` are allowed.
   -  No underscore ``_`` and no dot ``.`` and no upper case letter and
      no other special character (``@``, ``#``, ``*`` etc.).

Additionlly, a dataset name is built from different parts joined with
``-`` as follows (each part can contain additional ``-``):

.. code::

   purpose-content-source-resolution-start-year-end-year-frequency-version[-extra-str]

.. note::

   This is the current naming conventions for datasets in the Anemoi
   registry. It will need to be updated and adapted as more datasets are
   added. The part **purpose** is especially difficult to define for
   some datasets and may be revisited.

The tables below provides more details and some examples.

   -  -  Component
      -  Description

   -  -  **purpose**

      -  Can be `aifs` because the data is used to train the AIFS model.
         Is also sometime `metno` for data from the Norwegian
         Meteorological Institute. This definition may need to be
         revisited.

   -  -  **content**

      -  The content of the dataset CAN have four parts, such as:
         *class-type-stream-expver*

         -  **class**: od Operational archive (*class* is a MARS
            keyword)
         -  **type**: an Analysis (*type* is a MARS keyword)
         -  **stream**: oper Atmospheric model (*stream* is a MARS
            keyword)
         -  **expver**: 0001 (operational model)

   -  -  **source**
      -  mars (when data is from MARS), could be *opendap* or other.

   -  -  **resolution**
      -  o96 (could be : n320, 0p2 for 0.2 degree)

   -  -  **start-year**
      -  1979 if the first validity time is in 1979.

   -  -  **end-year**

      -  2020 if the first validity time is in 2020. Notice that if the
         dataset is from 18.04.2020 to 19.07.2020, the star-year and
         end-year are both 2020. For instance in
         aifs-od-an-oper-0001-mars-o96-2020-2020-6h-v5

   -  -  **frequency**
      -  1h (could be : 6h, 10m for 10 minutes)

   -  -  **version**

      -  This is the version of the content of the dataset, e.g. which
         variables, levels, etc. This is not the version of the format.
         There must be a "v" before the version number. The "v" is not
         part of the version number. For instance ...-v5 is the fifth
         version of the content of the dataset.

   -  -  **extra-str**

      -  Experimental datasets can have additional text in the name.
         This extra string can contain additional `-`. It provides
         additional information about the content of dataset.
