 Welcome to `anemoi-datasets` documentation!

.. warning::

   This documentation is work in progress.

*Anemoi* is a framework for developing machine learning weather
forecasting models. It comprises of components or packages for preparing
training datasets, conducting ML model training and a registry for
datasets and trained models. *Anemoi* provides tools for operational
inference, including interfacing to verification software. As a
framework it seeks to handle many of the complexities that
meteorological organisations will share, allowing them to easily train
models from existing recipes but with their own data.

An *Anemoi dataset* is a thin wrapper around a zarr_ store that is
optimised for training data-driven weather forecasting models. It is
organised in such a way that I/O operations are minimised.

This documentation is divided into two main sections: :ref:`how to use
existing datasets <using-introduction>` and :ref:`how to build new
datasets <building-introduction>`.
