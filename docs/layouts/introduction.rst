 Dataset organisation
######################

The `anemoi-datasets` package supports two types of data organisation
(called "layouts"), both of which are designed to efficiently store and
access large datasets:

-  **Gridded** data, such as fields, which are regular in space and time
   (with possibly some missing values).
-
-  **Tabular** data, such as observations, which are irregular in space
   and time.
