The following example presents a simple but comprehensive recipe to
create an anemoi dataset based on the atmospheric reanalysis ERA5. Once
built, the dataset could be used to train a ML atmospheric model such as
AIFS at low resolution. Note that a prebuilt version of the dataset
generated by this recipe will be soon made available.

.. literalinclude:: yaml/aifs-ea-an-oper-0001-mars-o48-2020-2021-6h-v1.yaml
   :language: yaml

Let's break down the recipe to understand the main ingredients.

### Dataset naming and description

.. code:: yaml

   name: aifs-ea-an-oper-0001-mars-o48-2020-2021-6h-v1

   description: Low resolution reduced dataset for documentation purposes

   attribution: ECMWF/C3S

   licence: CC-BY-4.0

In the first lines of the recipe we define the dataset name, a brief
description, the attribution to the data source, and the license under
which the dataset is released. This information will be stored in the
dataset metadata.

### Dates

.. code:: yaml

   dates:
       start: '2020-01-01T00:00:00'
       end: '2021-12-31T23:00:00'
       frequency: 6h

Here we define the time dimension of the anemoi dataset. In particular,
we specify the start and end dates of the dataset, and the frequency of
the time steps. In our specific example, the dataset is based on ERA5,
which has a 5 hour frequency, but we choose to downsample it to 6 hours
â€“ the typical timestep of the AIFS model. Note that this does not imply
that the timestep of the final model has to be 6 hours, but it could be
a multiple of it.
